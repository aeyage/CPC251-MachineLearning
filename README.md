# CPC251-MachineLearning
A compilation of CPC251 coursework; project, assignments, and lab/ tutorials.

CPC251 Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence is one of the courses that I take up during semester 2 AY22/23.

üìçThe first part of the course introduces methods of learning from data and explains the concepts behind various machine learning techniques. The course covers the basics of both supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. Students will learn to identify the characteristics of datasets, select features and machine learning algorithms, evaluate the performance of the machine learning models, and work on how to get the best performance. Students will also practice to construct machine learning models by integrating machine learning libraries and tools for various datasets and case studies. 

üìçThe second part of the course introduces the various techniques of computational intelligence. Various knowledge sources that are relevant to computational intelligence problems will be discussed. Students will also be exposed to advanced knowledge representation and reasoning approaches.


## Project Part 1
Our aim of this project is to creat machine learning models that can be used to correctly identify if a patient has cervical cancer or not based on the patient's information. The biopsy column, which reveals whether or not cervical cancer exists, is the target that has to be predicted. We intend to develop a prediction model that can aid in the early identification and diagnosis of cervical cancer by training machine learning models using a dataset that contains various patient features and biopsy information. The model will pick up on trends and connections in the data, allowing it to make precise predictions on patient samples it has never seen before. By offering an automated and effective method of cervical cancer prediction, this method of machine learning has the potential to help improve healthcare outcomes.
